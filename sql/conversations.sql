-- conversations.sql: DuckDB macros for analyzing Claude Code conversation logs
--
-- Prerequisites: A `raw_conversations` table must exist before loading this file.
-- DuckDB validates table references at macro definition time, so you must:
--   1. Define load_conversations() (or copy the definition below)
--   2. CREATE TABLE raw_conversations AS SELECT * FROM load_conversations(...)
--   3. Then load this file (which redefines load_conversations and adds all other macros)
-- Macro-to-macro references ARE deferred (resolved at call time).
-- All objects are CREATE OR REPLACE for idempotency.
-- See docs/vision/CONVERSATION_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md for design details.

-- 1. LOADING MACRO
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO load_conversations(path) AS TABLE
    SELECT *, filename AS _source_file
    FROM read_json_auto(
        path, union_by_name=true, maximum_object_size=33554432, filename=true
    );

-- 2a. SESSIONS - One row per session with metadata
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO sessions() AS TABLE
    SELECT
        sessionId AS session_id,
        regexp_extract(_source_file, '.claude/projects/([^/]+)/', 1) AS project_dir,
        last(slug ORDER BY timestamp) FILTER (WHERE slug IS NOT NULL) AS slug,
        last(version ORDER BY timestamp) FILTER (WHERE version IS NOT NULL) AS version,
        last(gitBranch ORDER BY timestamp) FILTER (WHERE gitBranch IS NOT NULL) AS git_branch,
        last(cwd ORDER BY timestamp) FILTER (WHERE cwd IS NOT NULL) AS working_dir,
        min(timestamp) AS started_at,
        max(timestamp) AS ended_at,
        age(max(timestamp), min(timestamp)) AS duration,
        count(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'user') AS user_messages,
        count(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'assistant') AS assistant_messages,
        count(*) FILTER (WHERE type = 'progress') AS progress_events,
