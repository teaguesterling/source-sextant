-- Fledgling: Code Intelligence Macros (sitting_duck)
--
-- Semantic code analysis powered by sitting_duck's AST parsing.
-- Replaces grep-based code search with structure-aware queries.

-- find_definitions: Find function, class, or variable definitions.
-- The core code search tool — replaces grep for "where is X defined?"
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM find_definitions('**/*.py');
--   SELECT * FROM find_definitions('src/**/*.py', 'parse%');
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO find_definitions(file_pattern, name_pattern := '%') AS TABLE
    SELECT
        file_path,
        name,
        semantic_type_to_string(semantic_type) AS kind,
        start_line,
        end_line,
        peek AS signature
    FROM read_ast(file_pattern)
    WHERE is_definition(semantic_type)
      AND name != ''
      AND name LIKE name_pattern
    ORDER BY file_path, start_line;

-- find_calls: Find function/method call sites.
-- Answers "where is this function called?"
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM find_calls('**/*.py');
--   SELECT * FROM find_calls('src/**/*.py', 'connect%');
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO find_calls(file_pattern, name_pattern := '%') AS TABLE
    SELECT
        file_path,
        name,
        start_line,
        peek AS call_expression
    FROM read_ast(file_pattern)
    WHERE is_call(semantic_type)
      AND name LIKE name_pattern
    ORDER BY file_path, start_line;

-- find_imports: Find import/include statements.
-- Answers "what does this file depend on?"
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM find_imports('**/*.py');
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO find_imports(file_pattern) AS TABLE
    SELECT
        file_path,
        name,
        peek AS import_statement,
        start_line
    FROM read_ast(file_pattern)
    WHERE is_import(semantic_type)
    ORDER BY file_path, start_line;

-- code_structure: Get a structural overview of files.
-- Shows the top-level definitions in a file/directory.
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM code_structure('src/main.py');
--   SELECT * FROM code_structure('src/**/*.py');
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO code_structure(file_pattern) AS TABLE
    SELECT
        file_path,

    WHERE is_definition(semantic_type)
      AND name != ''
      AND depth <= 2
    ORDER BY file_path, start_line;

-- complexity_hotspots: Find the most complex functions in a codebase.
-- Returns functions ranked by cyclomatic complexity with structural metrics.
-- Useful for identifying code that needs refactoring or careful review.
--
-- Note: requires materializing the AST into a temp table because
-- ast_function_metrics takes a table reference, not a file pattern.
-- This macro handles that internally.
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM complexity_hotspots('src/**/*.py');
--   SELECT * FROM complexity_hotspots('src/**/*.py', 10);
CREATE OR REPLACE MACRO complexity_hotspots(file_pattern, n := 20) AS TABLE

    ORDER BY cyclomatic DESC
    LIMIT n;

-- function_callers: Find all call sites for a named function across a codebase.
-- Answers "who calls X?" — the reverse of find_calls which shows what a file calls.
-- Groups by calling file and shows the enclosing function for each call site.
--
-- Examples:
--   SELECT * FROM function_callers('src/**/*.py', 'parse_config');
--   SELECT * FROM function_callers('**/*.py', 'validate');

-- module_dependencies: Map internal import relationships across a codebase.
